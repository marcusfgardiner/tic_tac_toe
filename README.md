Tic Tac Toe game

Before your interview, write a program that lets two humans play a game of Tic Tac Toe in a terminal. The program should let the players take turns to input their moves. The program should report the outcome of the game.

During your interview, you will pair on adding support for a computer player to your game. You can start with random moves and make the AI smarter if you have time.

Notes:
- I am currently interested in exploring recursion, so I used recursion for the functionality of the winChecker and aimed to create a winChecker that could handle a tic tac toe board of any size. As my goal for the winChecker was learning the use of recursion (rather than creating optimised code across the program), I translated the simple board array into an array of arrays to reduce cognitive load whilst implementing the recursion. Whilst overall this approach made the code for the winChecker more verbose, the class can handle a tic tac toe board of any size and I feel I now have a better understanding about how recursion can be used to make flexible code for evaluating data. I did not use any guides or look at any recursive implementations online to try to challenge myself to implement the recursion through my own original thought.
